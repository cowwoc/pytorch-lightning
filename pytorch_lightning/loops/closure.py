    Formally, a closure is binding variables from an external scope to a function that does a computation on these

    object which later can call it like a function but without requiring to pass in any arguments.

    This class provides a simple abstraction making the instance of this class callable like a function while capturing
    the :class:`ClosureResult` and caching it.

    The Closure gets created by the training loop(s) and is then passed to the
    :meth:`torch.optim.Optimizer.step` method. An optimizer is responsible for calling the closure and optionally
    do something with the output.

    Args:
        step_fn: This is typically the :meth:`pytorch_lightning.core.lightning.LightningModule.training_step
            wrapped with processing for its outputs
        backward_fn: A function that takes a loss value as input, performs back-propagation and returns the loss value.
            Can be set to ``None`` to skip the backward operation.
        zero_grad_fn: A function that zeroes the gradients. Can be set to ``None`` to skip zero_grad, for example
            when accumulating gradients.
        profiler: A profiler for profiling the actions of the passed in closure functions.

    Example:

        closure = Closure()
        optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(...)
